Bootstrap Study Summary (500 samples, each of size 150)

In this analysis, the full diabetes dataset (768 patients) was treated as the population.
Using bootstrap sampling with replacement, we created 500 samples, each containing 150 observations.

For each bootstrap sample, we calculated the following statistics for the variable BloodPressure:

Mean

Standard Deviation

98th Percentile

After computing these values for all 500 samples, we took the average of each statistic and compared them with the corresponding true population statistics.

1. Mean Comparison

The average bootstrap mean of BloodPressure was extremely close to the population mean.

This shows that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean when bootstrap sampling is used.

Minor differences occur due to sampling variation, but the values remain highly consistent.

2. Standard Deviation Comparison

The average bootstrap standard deviation was also close to the population standard deviation.

This indicates that bootstrapping provides a good approximation of the variability present in the population.

Since SD is more sensitive to variation, a slightly larger difference compared to the mean is normal.

3. 98th Percentile Comparison

The average bootstrap 98th percentile was reasonably close to the population 98th percentile, but the difference was slightly larger than for mean and SD.

This is expected because high percentiles are more sensitive to extreme values and require larger sample sizes to estimate accurately.

Still, the bootstrap method performs well and gives an acceptable approximation.

The bar charts comparing Population vs Bootstrap Averages for:

Mean BloodPressure

Standard Deviation

98th Percentile

all show that the bootstrap-derived values lie very close to the population values.
This visually confirms that the bootstrap method successfully replicates population characteristics.

Conclusion

The bootstrap procedure (500 samples of size 150) produced average statistics that are very close to the true population values for BloodPressure.

This demonstrates:

Bootstrap sampling can effectively estimate statistical properties of the population.

The sample mean and standard deviation are robust and reliable estimators.

Higher percentiles (like the 98th) show more variability, but still approximate well.

Overall, the bootstrap method is shown to be a powerful technique for estimating population statistics, even when sample sizes are moderate.
